# Javascript-Quiz

## Description

The objective of this project was to create a JavaScript quiz where the user would not see the quiz until they click the Start Button. Once they entered the quiz, a timer would start and there will be sounds playing based on the answer they select. 

What I was looking forward to with this project was how to put together a file using JavaScript and a website that was a Web API. 

We were provided with some code and I went ahead and utilzed what we were provided along with updating some of the code to be customized. 

Here is a screenshot of the website I created:
### Landing Page

### High Scores Page

I hope that this projects offers some insight into how web APIs work and how we can create games using websites. 

I would like to thank my instructor, my TAs, and my wife for the help with understanding JavaScript and Web APIs.
